This repository contains various **JavaScript coding exercises** and **concept implementations** that I practiced to strengthen my problem-solving skills and core JS knowledge.

The exercises covers below concepts:
- Variables, functions, and scopes  
- Arrays, maps, sets, and destructuring  
- Promises, async/await, and callbacks  
- Different ways of declaring and overloading functions  
- Looping techniques (`forEach`, `map`, `reduce`, `for...of`)
